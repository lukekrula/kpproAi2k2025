Rewritten version (same style, clearer meaning)
I have several domain classes in my Spring Boot app — Activity, Community, Member, Metadata, Partner, Program, Role, Task, Town, and User — and I need to connect them properly. A User has a Role. A Community has Members, and each Member can belong to multiple Communities. The same many‑to‑many relationship applies between Communities and Partners. A Community can create Programs, and Partners can donate to or otherwise participate in those Programs. Programs can also be shared with other Communities. Each Program contains Tasks that must be completed to achieve the Program’s goal. Every Community maintains a list of Activities they perform, and these Activities can influence whether a Partner decides to donate; the same Activity can appear in multiple Communities. A User is also a Member, so they can view the Communities they belong to, and they can be assigned to a Program and to specific Tasks within that Program.

📌 Functionalities we should incorporate (based on the description)
User & Role
User authentication and role-based access

User ↔ Role assignment

User is also a Member entity

Community
Community creation and management

Members can join multiple communities

Partners can be linked to multiple communities

Community has a list of Activities

Community can create Programs

Community can share Programs with other communities

Member
Member belongs to multiple communities

Member can be assigned to Programs

Member can be assigned to Tasks

Member can view communities they belong to

Partner
Partner participates in communities

Partner can donate to Programs

Partner decisions influenced by community Activities

Program
Programs created by communities

Programs shared with other communities

Programs contain Tasks

Members can be assigned to a Program

Task
Tasks belong to Programs

Tasks can be assigned to Members

Tasks must be completed to achieve Program goals

Tasks may have subtasks (hierarchy)

Activity
Communities maintain a list of Activities

Activities influence Partner donation decisions

Activities can appear in multiple communities

Town
Communities or Members may be linked to a Town
(depending on your domain model)

Metadata
Store additional info for entities (audit, tags, etc.)


User + Role + Member (1:1)

Community + Member (M:N)

Program + Community (creator)

Program + Community (sharedWith)

Program + Member (assignedMembers)

Task + Program + Member (assignedTo)

Partner + Community (M:N)

Activity + Community (M:N)

Metadata (generic)

This order avoids circular headaches and keeps the model evolving cleanly.
